# SMS_Backup_Reader

This is a Python script for reading the xml-files of SMS/MMS messages or calls exported from your phone with the App `SMS Backup & Restore`. Individual contacts can be selected and all their messages or calls can be exported to a text file.

Only needs vanilla Python 3+. (uses tkinter for the graphical user interface)

Optionally, if also PIL is installed, it shows MMS images in the app. These can always be saved to disk even if PIL is not available.

This was originally made as a quick project for a very special person, but turned out quite nice so I thought I'd share it with the world.
